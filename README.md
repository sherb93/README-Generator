# README Generator
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
This is a professional README Generator for programmers that already spend enough time writing code. Why should you have to spend all the time to remember the structure and syntax for a professional README thereafter? After running index.js in Node, npm inquirer will ask the user a short list of questions about the project and compile them into a clean, well-formatted README so that the ideas and concepts behind the project are effectively communicated to future users. In fact, I used the README Generator to create this README.
